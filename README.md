# Welcome to fillPDF!

This repo contains two parts of the software, each is in its own branch. 

So check out "gui" for a more advanced version with simple tKinter GUI, or "console" for the plain console application. 

The code has a demo template.pdf to try out. 

Feel free to adapt the scripts to your own need.

## Usage

Detailed usage is explained in README.md of each branch.

Generally you can:

- Fill a given PDF with Form Fields automatically from a xlsx file
- create PDFs for every entry in the xlsx file (i.e. for every row)
- generate the PDFs for every day in the specified span
- get a single PDF per day with all PDFs of the entries as pages
